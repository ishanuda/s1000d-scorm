                <title>COMPOSITION OF THE LESSON PLAN (LP)</title>
                <para>This LP provides an instructor with the information required to prepare for, and instruct in, the sections assigned. As an introduction to each section, the instructor shall display his/her name and the topic title on the visual aid panel. The instructor will also inform the trainees of the Terminal and Enabling Objectives (TOs/EOs), establish classroom procedures (questioning, note taking, breaks, etc.), and motivate the trainee by emphasizing the importance of the section. The LP is composed of sections, which are grouped into lessons. There are three types of sections in the LP: (1) Instructor-Led Training (ILT); (2) Instructor-Facilitated Training (IFT); and (3) Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI). ILT sections are taught either in the classroom or the lab depending on whether they are knowledge or skill training. IFT sections are taught in the classroom. IMI sections are self-paced training and do not require an instructor to lead the training.</para>
                <para>Each ILT section within this LP contains the following:<sequentialList> 
<listItem><para>Enabling Objective. This objective is written to reflect the appropriate knowledge or skill contained in the Job Task Duty Analysis (JDTA) in the Content Planning Module (CPM).</para> </listItem>
<listItem> <para>Trainee Preparation. This portion assigns the study and review material that the trainee must complete to prepare for this topic. It contains detailed assignments in reference publications, diagrams, and support materials.</para></listItem>
<listItem> <para>Instructor Preparation. This part of the topic page contains: <sequentialList><listItem><para>A reminder to review assigned trainee material.</para></listItem>
<listItem><para>A list of all reference materials required by the instructor to prepare for instructing the section.</para></listItem>
<listItem><para>A list of all trainee materials required for the section, including references, equipment, support materials, and test
                    equipment.</para></listItem></sequentialList></para></listItem>
<listItem> <para>Discussion-Demonstration-Activities (DDA). This page is divided into two columns, as follows: <sequentialList>
<listItem><para>Discussion Point (DP). This column outlines the subject matter to the depth necessary to support the training level(s) of the EO. Also, sufficient space is provided for instructor personalization.</para></listItem>
<listItem> <para>Related Instructor Activity (RIA). This column lists specific instructor activities, which will aid in trainee learning. This column provides the instructor specific instructions relative to reference documents, instructional media material, and guidance regarding trainee behavior during presentation of instruction. These activities carry the same number as the discussion points to which they are related. As with the discussion points, space is left for the instructor to add personalizing notes. The phrase "Reference ..." is used to help the instructor locate information applicable to a particular discussion point and direct the instructor to use that reference material in the classroom. The term "Refer to ..." or "Refer to and direct trainee to refer to ..." provides direction for the instructor when the reference material is actually intended for use in the classroom. If there is no related instructor activity for a discussion point, the space is left blank and the number omitted.</para></listItem></sequentialList></para></listItem></sequentialList></para>
            </levelledPara>
            <levelledPara>
                <title>FUNCTION OF THE LESSON PLAN</title>
                <para>The LP expands the approved Curriculum Outline of Instruction into a content format that will serve as an effective plan for instruction. It provides room for instructors to add individual notes. The form of the LP facilitates preparation, minimizes deviation from the approved plan for the topic, and lessens the need for rewriting material already contained in the outline. As the instructors prepare to teach the topic for the first time, they may write in the technical data, information, or notes to be used to do a professional job of instruction. As instructors gain experience teaching a topic, they may modify and improve the data written in.</para>
                <para>All theory discussions must relate to practical work. The design theory of an equipment may be interesting to the instructor, but the trainee must learn how to keep the equipment in proper operating condition. The trainee must bypass all unnecessary knowledge and concentrate on learning to perform the necessary maintenance techniques required by the equipment. Any activity that does not contribute directly to training in the operation and maintenance of the equipment is wasted effort, regardless of how interesting it may seem to be. A thorough understanding of the equipment theory is necessary in order that the practical work on the equipment may be accomplished. The reason for the theory is to assist the trainee in doing practical work.</para>
                <para>When approved by the Submarine Learning Center (SLC), this LP becomes the master plan for instruction.</para>
                <para>Changes to this plan are made by direction of SLC. All changes shall ensure effective trainee comprehension and fulfillment of terminal and enabling objectives.</para>
            </levelledPara>
            <levelledPara>
                <title>STUDY ASSIGNMENTS</title>
                <para>Study assignments are provided in the LP. One of the objectives of the training is learning to intelligently use the technical manuals associated with the equipments. Training effectiveness depends on conscientious and consistent use of the assignments and schematics in the pertinent technical manuals. All completed assignments should be reviewed with the trainee at the first opportunity.</para>
            </levelledPara>
            <levelledPara>
                <title>EQUIPMENT FAULTS</title>
                <para>The Fault Applicability List (FAL) in the LP lists the faults/fault insertion devices required in this course. When desirable, additional faults may be selected from the FAL.</para>
            </levelledPara>
            <levelledPara>
                <title>INSTRUCTION SHEETS</title>
                <para>Instruction sheets, consisting of information sheets, job sheets, assignment sheets, problem sheets, outline sheets, and diagram sheets are an integral part of the course and aid trainees in achieving the TOs/EOs. It is necessary to see that these activities are accurately completed. (NOTE: All instruction sheets are referred to as "Sheets" in the AIM I LO Module.)</para>
            </levelledPara>
            <levelledPara>
                <title>TRAINING MATERIAL SUPPORT PROGRAM</title>
                <para>The Training Material Support Program has been established for the purpose of improving the curriculum and other training materials. It is each instructor's responsibility to become familiar with this program as outlined in the applicable management documentation. You are to submit all your suggestions for improvement through a Change Recommendation as outlined in the applicable management documentation.</para>
                <para>These suggestions should include discrepancies found or any comments that you feel will improve training. There will be no changes in this curriculum until authorized by SLC.</para>
            </levelledPara>
            <levelledPara>
                <title>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS</title>
                <para>When performing procedures on equipment, all trainees must adhere to all safety precautions, including Notes, Warnings, and Cautions contained in the procedural documentation. Safety must be part of each day of training so that the trainee will develop safe working habits. Practice and Teach Safety!</para>
