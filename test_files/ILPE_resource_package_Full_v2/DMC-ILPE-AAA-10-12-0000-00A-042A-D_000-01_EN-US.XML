                <title>Feed Water System</title>
                <para>The feed water system receives DI water through the feed water solenoid valve (SV-621G). Water is added to the GGS process loop whenever the level in the LP phase separator (PHS-030G) drops below about 20 percent (L-1013G). A check valve (CV-622G) provides protection in the event of high pressure pulses due to the return of protonically pumped water from the HP phase separator (PHS-138G). The DI water pressure of greater than 25 psig is adequate to deliver the water to the process loop and allow the flushing drain line to be located at a higher level than the ILPE DI-bed. The feed water flows through the ILPE DI-bed (DIB-623G) to further assure low ion content, is checked by resistivity sensor (RS-1611G) and then flows through a series of valves prior to entering the process loop at the outlet of the electrolysis cell stack.</para>
            
                <para>The feed water components (i.e., the DI bed) are protected from overpressure by a relief valve (RV-628G) (refer to paragraph 3.9.1.4.1). While hydraulic lockup may also occur between solenoid valves SV-621G, SV-652G, SV-625G and SV-627G, the combination of the relief valve and the built-in overpressure relief characteristics of the solenoid valves protect the plumbing from damage from high pressure due to hydraulic lockup.</para>
            
            <levelledPara id="par-3.7.1.3.1">
                <title>Protonically Pumped Water Return</title>
                <para>Since the protonically pumped water has a pH of about four (slightly acidic), it flows through the DI-bed to remove any metal ions prior to returning to the process loop for reuse. Approximately 16 gph of protonically pump water flows at maximum product gas production rate. (Refer to paragraph 3.2.2).</para>
